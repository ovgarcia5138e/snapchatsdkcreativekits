<h2>Snapchat Like Camera in Android</h2>
<p>Recently, while working on one of my projects, I was required to develop a camera similar to Snapchat camera. It took me a few weeks to develop it and now I decided to share it with others so anyone looking to build something similar can get help from my code.<br />

<strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Camera button</strong>: tap to capture image. Hold to record video of max limit 10 seconds.</li><li><strong>Flash control button</strong>.</li><li><strong>Camera switch button:</strong> to switch between front and back cameras.</li><li><strong>Stickers:</strong> you can add stickers to your photos and videos. Place stickers anywhere on camera preview and adjust their sizes accordingly.</li><li><strong>Add Text:</strong> similar to stickers, you can also add text to images and videos and change its font colour.</li><li><strong>Save media:</strong> you can also save images and videos to your device.</li><li><strong>Upload:</strong> there is a button to upload images to web. However server side programming needs to be done.</li></ul><br />Here is how end result will look like:<br /><br /><img src="http://haq.life/media/blog/blog-89-1.jpg" width="825" height="480" /><br /><br /><p>I hope that my code will be useful to you for your projects.
